  <p>I am a post-doc researcher at the Astroparticle and Cosmology lab (APC) from the Université Paris Cité, funded by the LabEx UnivEarthS on the interface project<br> "Binary rEvolution: from binary evolution towards merging of compact objects".<br><br>
  I am interested in the observation of X-ray binaries in optical/infrared in order to better constrain their environnement, transient nature as well as their role as gravitational wave merger progenitors.<br><br>
  I have worked with data coming from prestigious facilities such as ESO/VLT (X-Shooter, ISAAC, FORS2 and VIRCAM) as well as the latest release from the Gaia satellite. I am a member of the ENGRAVE collaboration in the operations team contributing with my expertise on VLT/X-Shooter and FORS2.
